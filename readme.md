# emacs.d
The emacs configuration of mine. The modal keys are made with [modalka](https://github.com/mrkkrp/modalka) package and keys layout itself is borrowed from [xah-fly-keys](https://github.com/xahlee/xah-fly-keys).

## Installation
Make sure that you use a latest version of emacs. If you are a mac os user, you can use [homebrew](https://brew.sh) to upgrade the installed version of it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sullenor/emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d
```
