# emacs.d
Attempt to create an alternative to sublime text and vscode. In case you wonder why Emacs and any tool, I'd say that its customization possibilities are beyond imagination and it is very interesting to explore them yourself :)

And did you know that [Emacs is sexy](https://emacs.sexy)?

## Installation
Get latest version of emacs. If you are a mac os user, you can use [homebrew](https://brew.sh) to install it.

```bash
brew cask install emacs
```

Clone emacs settings to home directory.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sullenor/emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d
```

Enjoy ðŸ˜‰
